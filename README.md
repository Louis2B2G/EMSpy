## Exploiting HDMI Electromagnetic Leakage to Spy on Computers

Electromagnetic waves are known to be emitted from electric currents, a consequence of Maxwell's equations. HDMI cables, a popular medium for transmitting video signals, emits radio waves which can be captured and interpreted by an outside attacker. EMSpy is a Python toolkit for conducting such Tempest (Van Eck Phreaking) attacks using IQ signals obtained with an SDR radio.
